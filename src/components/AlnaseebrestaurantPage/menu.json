      "description": "France. Straw-gold, bright and clear in appearance. A lovely bead in the glass forms a cortege of regular, delicate bubbles. On the nose, the Champagne offers magnificent, vivacious character. Citrus fruit aromas are followed by a cavalcade of floral bouquets, elderberry and vine blossom. Delicious brioche notes and the simplicity of lightly toasted bread and roasted almonds. Well balanced and harmonious on the palate, summoning flavours of brioche, together with crunchy cherries and the sun-kissed blush of white peach. Clean on the finish, with all the freshness of just-picked walnuts.",
